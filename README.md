# VerdictAI

Real-time Chain-of-Debate claim verification with explainable evidence and transparent reasoning.

VerdictAI is an AI-powered fact-checking system that:
1. Takes a claim (from social media, news, or any source)
2. Retrieves real-time evidence from the web
3. Runs a structured multi-agent debate (Verifier vs Skeptic, moderated)
4. Produces a verdict with confidence scores
5. Generates explainable reasoning with full debate transcript
6. Provides share-ready response templates
7. Stores outcomes for repeated-claim detection

Built with Chain-of-Debate architecture for transparent, trustworthy AI fact-checking.

## Key Features

### Core Fact-Checking Pipeline

**1. Evidence Retrieval**
- Real-time web search using You.com API
- Retrieves both supporting AND refuting evidence
- Ensures balanced information gathering

**2. Multi-Agent Debate System**
- **Verifier Agent**: Argues FOR the claim using supporting evidence
- **Skeptic Agent**: Argues AGAINST the claim, identifying flaws and risks
- **Moderator Agent**: Adjudicates the debate and delivers final verdict

**3. Intelligent Analysis**
- Verdict: TRUE | FALSE | MIXED | UNCERTAIN
- Confidence Score: 0-100% based on evidence strength
- Risk Level: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH
- Topic Classification: HEALTH | FINANCE | POLITICS | GENERAL

**4. Explainable AI (XAI)**
- Full debate transcript showing agent reasoning
- Key reasons with bullet points
- Identified uncertainties and limitations
- Evidence citations with source URLs

**5. Smart Memory System**
- SQLite database with fuzzy matching
- Detects repeated/similar claims (85% similarity threshold)
- Instant retrieval prevents redundant analysis
- 100ms response time for cached claims vs 3-8s for new claims

**6. Share-Ready Responses**
- Three response templates: Neutral, Firm, Friendly
- Appropriate tone based on verdict confidence
- Copy-paste ready for social media

## How It Works

### The Analysis Pipeline

```
User Input: "Drinking bleach cures COVID-19"
    |
    v
[1. Evidence Retrieval]
    - Search: "drinking bleach cures COVID-19" (5 results)
    - Search: "debunk drinking bleach cures COVID-19" (5 results)
    |
    v
[2. Multi-Agent Debate]
    - Verifier: "No credible medical sources support this"
    - Skeptic: "Strong evidence of harm; this is dangerous"
    - Both agents present structured arguments
    |
    v
[3. Moderator Decision]
    - Verdict: FALSE
    - Confidence: 95%
    - Risk: HIGH (health misinformation)
    - Topic: HEALTH
    |
    v
[4. Output Generation]
    - Key reasons (3 bullet points)
    - Full debate transcript
    - Evidence cards (supporting/refuting)
    - Share-ready response templates
    |
    v
[5. Memory Storage]
    - Store in database for future reference
    - Enable instant recall for similar claims
```
